    "description" : "Modified Pavilion Town objects used by template Brawl, should be better suited for short games on small maps.<br>Ziggurat: defended by 3-5x 1 Sphinx, reward: 1500-2500 Gold, 4-8 Crystals and Gems, 2-4 Spells from different Schools<br>The Snake Temple Creature Bank is left as it is. It's power is actually okay as a rare slightly (but not too much!) bigger non-rechargable bank.<br>All creatures that have upgrades, both guards and rewards have a chance of being upgraded.<br>All banks recharge after 4 full days pass.<br>They are not designed to be taken with your whole army but with parts of your army in multiple places at once.",
